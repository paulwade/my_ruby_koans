    # 
    # ENLIGHTENMENT
    # In my opinion this is a trick question since the correct answer
    # seems to be that Ruby treats the {} as a block and therefore 
    # would not have resulted in comparing one hash to another.  The
    # reason I think it's a trick question is because we have not 
    # covered blocks in Ruby yet.  Reference:
